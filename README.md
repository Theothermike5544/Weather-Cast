# Weather-Cast

## Server-Side APIs - Weather-Cast
The purpose of this application was to demonstrate the functionality of server-side api's to retrieve data stored on an external server's api. The application developed functions by allowing users to utilize the Openweather One Call API to retrieve weather data on searched cities. The data is then retrieved and displays Weather Condition, Wind, Temperature, Humidity and UV Index. The data is then stored locally. Additionally there will be functions to show a 5 day forecast as well as removing the search history. Unfortunately while I got the application to semi-work, I ran out of time. I do intend to finish the application this weekend in full.
